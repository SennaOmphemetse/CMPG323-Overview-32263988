## Project 2-API Development:

This will be the second repository created for the development of the APIs. Everything related to the APIs will be held in this repository.

## Project 3-standards and patterns:

This repository will be created to house the standards and patterns that will be employed throughout the system's development.

## Project 4-testing of projects and RPA(Robotic Process Automation):

This repository will be created to test the implementation, and the RPA will be used to make it simple to build and manage bots within the implementation.

## Project 5-reporting and monitoring:

The system that will be constructed will be reported and monitored on this repository. This phase's goal is to look for faults and bugs that need to be reported and fixed.

## Branching Strategy: Trunk based Development

Each project will employ the trunk-based development strategy. The branch, which is the single branch, will be cloned for each project, and then all modifications and other commitments or features will be applied to that branch, and once the compilers and tests are successful, the user, who is I, will push the work directly to the main branch and merge straight to the master(branch) as soon as I, the user, is finalized with it.

## the use of a .gitignore file within each project

Because every file I push to the remote repository is viewable and public, the .gitignore file's role in each project is to reduce the possibility of certain files being opened or accessible to viewers. It will help by preventing some confidential files from being pushed to the remote repository. The .gitignore file will be created in each project and will contain all of the files and folders in that project that we do not want to be pushed to the remote repository.

## Storage of credentials and sensitive info

Because the primary purpose of GitHub will be to host project (code) repositories, confidential and sensitive data will not be stored in the repository prior to branch commit. Another approach that could work is to disable forking by making the project private because forking enables individuals to copy the repository while not affecting the original project. Most of the time. gitignore will also be useful.
